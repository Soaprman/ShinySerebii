# ShinySerebii

This is just a user script I made to make Serebii a little easier on my eyes. It includes bigger text, a lighter color scheme, and changing type display from images to colored cells (like on Bulbapedia).

If you want to use it, just add it as a user script in your browser with an extension like GreaseMonkey.

You can toggle certain parts of it by changing flags at the top of the script.

I make no promises that this will work or be maintained in the future.
