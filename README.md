# ShinySerebii

This is just a user script I made to make Serebii a little easier on my eyes. It includes bigger text, a lighter color scheme, and changing type display from images to colored cells (like on Bulbapedia).

It only works on the Pokedex pages. Maybe I'll make it work on other pages someday.

If you want to use it, just add it as a user script in your browser with an extension like GreaseMonkey.

You can toggle certain parts of it by changing flags at the top of the script.

I make no promises that this will work or be maintained in the future.
